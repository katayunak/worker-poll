This Go program implements a concurrent worker pool system with structured retry handling, a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), and performance profiling via pprof. A specified number of workers (workerNumber) are launched to process incoming jobs sent through the jobs channel. Each job is defined by a simple job struct containing an ID and a numeric result field. Workers continuously listen for jobs and attempt to process each one using the processJob function, which simulates random failures. When a failure occurs, the worker retries the job up to maxRetries times, applying an incremental backoff delay ((attemptNumber * 2)ms) between attempts to avoid flooding the system with rapid retries. If all retry attempts fail, the job is pushed into a dedicated Dead Letter Queue (dlq) channel for later inspection or separate handling. The program uses a sync.WaitGroup to ensure all workers complete their processing before the application exits, while a context.Context provides a mechanism for graceful cancellation if needed. Additionally, an HTTP server is started in the background to expose Go’s built-in pprof endpoints at 127.0.0.1:6060, enabling runtime profiling and debugging (e.g., analyzing goroutines, CPU, or memory usage). Once all jobs are dispatched, the jobs channel is closed, workers finish, and the application gracefully reports completion. This design showcases practical concepts like worker pooling, retry logic with backoff, DLQ handling, context-driven cancellation, and pprof-based observability—forming a foundational architecture that can be extended with features like structured error classification, DLQ consumer logic, metrics, and production-grade logging
